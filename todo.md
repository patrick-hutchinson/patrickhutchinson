List View: Going to the top works super well because a clear top is defined. Going to the bottom leads to unintuitive interaction. It would be better if a clear bottom im defined and the scale and height of the li's (the min height I think) is adjusted dynamically.

Page transition:
from home, the sections fade out randomly with delay. The new page gets loaded with a grid overlay that is also 3 x 3, but all white. those times fade out, and the overlay gets removed. to reveal the page under it as "tiles" also.
